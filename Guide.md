## General Idea
The python project system that was made for this project (pypstem) supports multiple versions.
When you call the script, it first builds the configuration.
It consists of three layers:
    1. data/config.json
    2. data/ver/$v/config.json
    3. data/config.user.json
If more than one were found, the one with the lower number does overwrite the settings.  
If a setting is a list, then it is added to. This includes modules.  
Then it tries to find the version by checking:  
    1. Loose binary (the script sorts this automatically)  
    2. Given input (parameter)  
    3. Previous version (data/.version)  
Once thats done, the default compiler (set in config.json) is being downloaded to ensure atleast one exists.  
After that, the split system it started. it supports 2 modes:  
    - no split (default)  
    - yes split (--split)  
    If you dont split, it generates the stubs and dependency files so that the compiler can work with the functions.  
    If you do, the assembly will be split into many different files, and the build system will compile decompilation alongside split code.  
    Note that this is really slow, because the linker has to deal with a lot of sections. This cannot be avioded, as the functions need these separate sections.  
Next, the modules specified in the config are built. Here it does juggle around a bunch of settings, and build all sources it could find from a module.  
For each module, a library exists. It contains all the object files, and the linker can decide which functions to take in.  
If no modules exist, none will be built.  
Now before the linking step, the linker map and the json files (compile_commands, objdiff) are created.  
Lastly, it does link all the library files. Afterwards it does export a code.bin file from the build .axf file.  

## Project Setup
This system was made with customizability in mind.  
For details on how it works, read the General Idea chapter above.
Note that --split was NOT tested with thumb code, and may break in that scenario.

### Map.csv
This file is a list of all symbols.  
**Start**: Address where this symbols starts  
**Pool\***: If function has a data pool, this is the start address of it.  
**End**: Total end of the function.  
**Section\***: If specified, groups functions together. only for last/next, not gaps.  
**Rank**: status of matching. O=Matching, M=Size Mismatch, m=Small Mismatch, U=Undefined  
**Type**: see Types below  
**Symbol\***: Name of the symbol. if empty, fn_x or dat_x is used (only when needed)  

### Types
- f: Function
   - (none): i.x
   - t: t.x template function
   - s: assembly function
- d: Data
   - (none): .sdata_x (custom section name to use with macro, to force section creation for local symbols)
   - g: :glob:x
   - c: .constdata_x data constant
   - d: .data_x
   - b: .bss_x
